Patrick's Operating System

This is my attempt to create an operating system. Much of this code is buggy, doesn't do what it says it will, does funny things without adequate explanation, relies on hacks to get things done when properly thought out algorithms would produce better code, crashes, and should only be run in an emulator. In short, this is experimental code and I make no guarantees about anything. Run at your own risk. This is being created for my own entertainment and learning purposes. The quality of the code reflects my understanding of operating system concepts. My code is being put on GitHub to make it easier for me to share with others via the Internet. I'm hoping that sharing my code will allow me to ask better, more precise questions, and solicit interest, feedback, constructive criticism, and helpful comments from other Internet users.
